[Overview](#overview)
========

The following themes connect my work in developing students, building and
sustaining Olin College, and effecting change in engineering education:

### Exploring the use of computation throughout the curriculum.

A major goal of my projects is to develop new approaches to engineering, math,
and science using computation. These projects make the
material more engaging, shift the balance from theory toward practice, and
bring into the undergraduate curriculum topics often assumed to be
accessible only at the graduate level.

### Integrating Data Science and Bayesian Statistics with engineering.

Another goal of my work is to make working with data and
reasoning about probability a more central part of the engineering
toolkit. In many engineering schools, students study mathematical
statistics in a way that does not prepare them to work with real data;
and almost none of them study Bayesian statistics.  I want to change
the way engineers learn about these topics so they use data to answer
questions and guide decision-making under uncertainty.

### Applying the philosophy of Free Software to writing, science, and education.

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses make possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and lead to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.

My course material, slides from my presentations, and material from my
workshops are published on the web. And the supporting code for my
classes and books are on GitHub, where anyone can copy, modify, and make
corrections and contributions.

In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
constant feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don't publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.

### Creating authentic experiences that connect students to external audiences.

A lot of what students write in college doesn’t work because they are
asked to write with no audience in mind and no goal for the project. In
my classes, especially Data Science and Complexity Science, I create opportunities
for students to write for real audiences.

I also engage students in my writing projects, often using independent
study projects to develop and test preliminary materials, then inviting
students to provide feedback on early drafts, and providing
opportunities for them to contribute material (as in the


All of these projects are intended to have impact within Olin, by preparing
students and continuing the development of our curriculum, and outside Olin,
by providing materials used by other colleges, helping professions review or
retrain, and influencing the content and pedagogy of undergraduate engineering
education.



[Data Science](#data-science)
============

I am continuing work to develop our curriculum in data science, including
probability and statistics, Bayesian statistics, and complexity science.

Courses and books
-----------------

In Fall 2016 I taught Computational Bayesian Statistics and published several blog
articles based on student work.

Multimedia
----------

In October 2012 I presented a webcast with O’Reilly Media called
*Bayesian Statistics Made Simple*
[Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/2392)

In September 2015 I made a 3.5 hour video series called *Data
Exploration in Python*, published by O’Reilly Media.
[Video series](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044932.do)

In May 2016 I presented a webcast for O’Reilly Media called
*Learning to Love Bayesian Statistics*.
[Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3707)
I also presented this talk at 
[Strata in October 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6d-AbkhBQ8) and at
Bentley College in April 2016.

I have also made a number of presentations related to Data Science for
special interest groups in the Boston area, most recently "Bayesian Bandits
from Scratch" for the inaugural meeting of Boston Bayesians, July 2016.


Workshops
---------

Complementary to my teaching at Olin, I have developed a number of
workshops related to Data Science.

In Fall 2011, I presented the first version of “There is Only One Test”
as a webcast for O’Reilly Media. [Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/2016)

This topic has been a recurring theme in my blog and the basis of my
half-day workshop, “Computational Statistics”, which I presented at
Pycon 2015 and 2016, and SciPy 2015.
[Workshop site](https://sites.google.com/site/pyinference/)
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR52vSbHBAk)

In 2012 I created “Bayesian Statistics Made Simple”, which I presented
as a half-day workshop at PyCon 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and
also at SciPy 2015 and a few other venues.
[Workshop site](https://sites.google.com/site/simplebayes/)
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpgiFIGXcT4)

In Summer 2016, Sanjoy Mahajan and I taught a focus workshop for the
Olin Collaboratory, “Bayesian Statistics for Undergrads”, based on our
different approaches to this topic.
[Workshop site](https://github.com/AllenDowney/BayesForUndergrads)


Consulting
----------

In Fall 2014 I started collaborating with DataKind, a non-profit
organization in New York that provides data science services for
mission-driven institutions. On several projects since then, I have
worked as a “data creative”, involved in the early stages of a project
to help identify opportunities, evaluate data and other technical
issues, and prepare projects for hand-off to a team of volunteer data
scientists.
[Featured volunteer page](http://www.datakind.org/featured-volunteers/allen-downey)

In May 2015 I flew to Orbitz headquarters in Chicago to deliver a
workshop on Bayesian statistics and to consult with groups working on
related projects.

In Spring 2016 I was appointed to the advisory board of ViaScience, a
Cambridge company that provides services related to Bayesian statistics.
[Press release](http://www.viascience.com/allen-downey-joins-via-sciences-advisory-board)

I am also on the advisory board of WebText, a company that provides
customer support platforms based on instant messaging.
[Press release](https://www.webtext.com/team/dr-allen-downey/)


Publications
------------

In addition to my workshops, I write articles that apply computational
and Bayesian statistics to data-driven explorations.

These include “Estimating the age of renal tumors”, which started as a
letter to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs in support of a patient;
later it became a chapter of *Think Bayes* and an article I
published on ArXiv in 2012. [ArXiV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6890)

In 2014 I developed an example of logistic regression as material for
"Data Science", then published “Religious affiliation, education and
Internet use” on ArXiv. The abstract was picked up by MIT’s
*Technology Review*, and attracted substantial media
attention. [ArXiV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5534)
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/04/21/303375159/americas-less-religious-study-puts-some-blame-on-the-internet), 
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/is-the-internet-bad-for-religion/2014/04/10/06f9f7a0-c0f3-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html), 
[Fox News](http://video.foxnews.com/v/3442766571001/is-surfing-the-web-destroying-your-faith/?#sp=show-clips), 
[A surprisingly good vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04jjBv6QR8k)

In 2015, I developed an example of survival analysis for "Data Science",
which lead to “Will Millennials Ever Get Married?”, which I presented at
SciPy 2015, and which appeared in the proceedings. A student, Lindsey
Vanderlyn, collaborated on this project as an independent study.
[SciPy proceeedings](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/)

In 2011, I started a blog called “Probably Overthinking It”, where I
publish articles related to data science and Bayesian statistics. Many
of these articles involve short original statistical explorations, often
using datasets from government agencies and other resources.
[My blog](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/)

Many of these articles attract attention on social media, blog
aggregators, and other media. Most articles attract more than 1000 page
views, several more than 10,000 views and a few more than 100,000. Since
2011, I have posted almost 150 articles and received more than 1.3 million
page views.

The five most popular articles are:

* [“Are first babies more likely to be late?”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/02/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late.html)

* [“All your Bayes are belong to us”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/10/all-your-bayes-are-belong-to-us.html)

* [“My favorite Bayes’s Theorem problems”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-favorite-bayess-theorem-problems.html)

* [“Bayesian survival analysis for *Game of Thrones*”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/03/bayesian-survival-analysis-for-game-of.html) Guest article by Ben Kahle and Erin Pierce.

* [“The Inspection Paradox is Everywhere”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere.html)


Future plans 
------------

In Fall 2016 I will co-teach the successor of "Computational Modeling",
called "Complexity Science", with Prof Jason Woodard.  In preparation,
I am revising
*Think Complexity* with the goal of publishing a second
edition in 2017, possibly including a new selection of student projects
as case studies.

In Fall 2016 I will teach Computational Bayesian Statistics and start
work on the second edition of *Think Bayes*. I will invite
students to develop articles we can publish in my blog, ArXiV, in the
proceedings of SciPy, or other venues.

I will continue to write blog articles as opportunities arise, looking
for topics that demonstrate the methodology of computational and
Bayesian statistics, applied to topics in science, engineering, and
social science. I have a substantial backlog of project ideas waiting to
be developed.

In Spring 2017 I will teach Data Science again, incorporating changes in
the structure and content that Paul Ruvolo developed in Spring 2016.

I expect to continue teaching workshops related to computational and
Bayesian statistics, and to look for opportunities to work with
companies interested in these areas. We are likely to have SCOPE
projects in these areas, which I will help to develop and advise.

And I plan to continue work with DataKind, depending on what projects
come through their pipeline. I will continue to look for opportunities
to connect this work with students and classes at Olin.


[Computation and Engineering](#computation-and-engineering) 
===========================

Since my last reappointment I have continued to teach and develop
software-related classes, including “Software Design”, “Software
Engineering”, and “Software Systems”, and software-based approaches to
topics in engineering, primarily “Modeling and Simulation” and “Signals
and Systems”.

Software Design
---------------

I taught Software Design in Spring and Fall 2011 and wrote the first
edition of *Think Python*, published by O’Reilly Media in
2012. *Think Python* is my most popular book: it is used in
high school and college classes around the world (see Appendix); the
free PDF version is downloaded from my web page almost 100,000 times per
month; and we sell hundreds of paper and electronic copies per month.
[Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)

In Fall 2013, I taught Software Design again and began work on the
second edition of *Think Python*, which turned out to be a
substantial revision. It was published in 2015.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/sd13fa/), 
[Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

Software Systems
----------------

In Fall 2012, I attempted a major revision of Software Systems, which
went badly for a number of reasons: one was a mismatch between the focus of the
class and the textbook we used; another was a badly-implemented set of
in-class activities.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softsys12/)

In Fall 2014, I addressed the first problem by developing a textbook
called *Think OS*, and the class was more successful.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softsys14/)

In Fall 2015, I addressed the second problem by deploying [EduScrum](http://eduscrum.nl/en/), a
structure for student learning based on the Scrum methodology for
software development. I thought both elements – *Think OS*
and EduScrum – worked well, and I am considering using EduScrum for
other classes. [Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softwaresystems2015/)


Modeling and Simulation
-----------------------

In June 2008, John Geddes and I went to the University of Delft to meet
with Mark Somerville to develop “Modeling and Simulation”, which we
taught for the first time in Fall 2008.

I wrote a textbook for the class, officially known as *Physical
Modeling in MATLAB*, which I self-publish through a small company
I run, Green Tea Press.
[Physical Modeling in MATLAB](http://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/)

Since I was on leave in 2009, we brought in other instructors to teach
and continue to develop the course. This model worked well; now about
one third of our faculty have taught ModSim at some point, and it has
become one of our tools for onboarding new faculty.

I co-taught ModSim again in 2010 and 2014.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/modsim14/)


Signals and Systems
-------------------

In Spring 2014 I started work on *Think DSP*, collaborating
with two students working on independent study projects.

In Fall 2014 I offered "Computational DSP" for the first time, and then in
Spring 2015 I used this material when I co-taught "Signals and Systems"
with Profs Siddhartan Govindasamy and Oscar Mur-Miranda. Our first attempt at
a major revision had some rough edges, but I think the quality of the
final projects demonstrates that this approach is effective:
[SigSys final projects](https://sites.google.com/site/sigsys15/problem/final-project)

In July 2015 I presented material from *Think DSP* at
SciPy. [Video of presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ALKGR0I5MA)

While developing *Think DSP*, I created a blog to publish
draft chapters from the book and related articles. This blog is not as
popular as *Probably Overthinking It*, but I have published
14 articles there, including a guest post from a student team in
"Software Systems".
[SoftSys project](http://thinkdsp.blogspot.com/2015/10/fur-elise-on-arduino-synthesizer.html)

I was also invited to contribute articles to *DSP Related*,
a collection of blogs related to DSP. I have published five articles
there; the most popular is “Bayes Meets Fourier”, which presents an
efficient algorithm for a Bayes filter as used for location tracking and
other applications. This work is based on conversations with Paul Ruvolo
during our “Kalman and Bayes filter book club” in Fall 2015.
[DSP Related blog](https://www.dsprelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Allen_Downey.php)

In August 2016 *Think DSP* was published by O’Reilly Media.
[Think DSP](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/)


Software Engineering
--------------------

In Spring 2011 and Spring 2013 I taught "Software Engineering" and
developed materials related to algorithms and data structures in Java.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softengjava13/)

In Fall 2012 I began a collaboration with Prof Chris Mayfield at James
Madison University, revising my book *How To Think Like a Computer
Scientist* under the new title *Think Java*, which
was published by O’Reilly Media in June 2016.
[Think Java](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java/)

In February 2016 I was commissioned by the Flatiron School in New York
to develop a curriculum for their online class on data structures and
algorithms in Java, using material from "Software Engineering". The first
group of students (including at least two from Olin) tested the course in Summer 2016.

I am making plans to develop this material into a book (working
title *Think Algorithms*), and I am considering testing it with a group
of Olin students in the fall.


Other classes
-------------

In Spring 2012 I sat in on "Principles of Engineering", which was taught
by Chris Murphy. This experience allowed me to make connections between
our software classes and other areas of engineering; as an example, I
introduced a project in "Software Systems" where students build and
program an Arduino-based synthesizer
[SoftSys synthesizer](http://thinkdsp.blogspot.com/2014/02/build-softsyssynth.html)

Also in Spring 2012 I taught "Foundations of Computer Science" and
developed new material related to languages, automata, computability and
Godel’s theorem using Python.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/focsolin12/)

I advised the following SCOPE projects: Parietal Systems, 2012-13; Facebook, 2013-14; Apportable 2014-15.


Student-led classes
-------------------

In Fall 2011 I was the advisor for one of the first student-led classes on mobile application development (MobDev),
and I led an independent study on teaching and learning for the 4 student instructors.

In Fall 2012, ModDev was led by an alumnus, Rachel Steadman; I was the adviser
for 6 students who completed the class as an OSS project.

In Spring 2013, a group of students developed a new course on web application development, called WebDev, and
we adopted a structure where I was the adviser of the 24 students in the class -- I met with the student instructors
to discuss the operation of the class -- and another faculty member led an independent study project on
teaching and learning with the student instructors.

In Fall 2013, a new version of MobileProto was offered, and in Spring 2014, another version of WebDev.  But we
started to see more variability in the quality of the experience and the outcomes.

In Summer 2014, I worked with Paul Ruvolo to define criteria and processes for student-led classes.
[Guidelines for student-led classes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PqmT8kTsmKT2vd0YmjtnG-Ih97QsVIIuZJ4gEo4Vblo/edit?usp=sharing)

In Fall 2014, Paul and I co-advised an offering of MobileProto that tested the new procedures.  The result
was an improved experience for the students in the class and the student instructors (not to mention
the advisers).

In Spring 2015, Paul and I co-advised an offering of WebDev, also known as OlinJS.  Under the new procedures, the process went smoothly
and the class was very successful.

In Fall 2015 and Spring 2016, Paul advised student-led classes, with Profs Mark Somerville and Zhenya Zastavker
acting as advisers for the student instructors.  The Spring 2016 offering of OlinJS was particularly successful.
[Web page for OlinJS, Spring 2016](http://olinjs.github.io)



Future plans
------------

In Spring 2017 I will teach "Software Systems" again, possibly co-teaching
with Ben Hill. I think we have an opportunity to improve the connection
between SoftSys and "Computer Architecture", and to ensure that we have
more flexibility in future offerings of SoftSys.

I am continuing work on *Think OS*, planning to incorporate
material from *The Little Book of Semaphores* and to make
the accompanying thread simulator, Sync, more robust.
[Sync web page](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/sync.html)

In
many CS programs, introductory classes are moving from languages like C
and C++ to higher-level languages like Python [CACM article](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext). This shift creates a gap
between the introductory sequence and classes like "Operating Systems" and
"Networks". *Think OS* is in a good position to fill that gap.

For several years we have discussed the possibility of shifting ModSim
from MATLAB to Octave, Python, or Mathematica. If we make a move like
that, I will probably revise *Physical Modeling in MATLAB*
accordingly.

For the more remote future, I have my eyes open for opportunities to
collaborate with colleagues to develop computational approaches in other
areas of engineering, math, and natural and social science.


[Collaboratory](#collaboratory)
=============

In Summer 2011 I visited KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm to meet with instructors who
had previously participated in workshops at Olin.

In 2013, 2014, and 2015 I participated in the Collaboratory Summer
Institute and co-led at least one workshop.  In 2016 I participated but did not lead a workshop.
[Summer institute](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/summer-institute/student-engagement)

In Spring 2014 I visited the University of Albany and led a curriculum
development workshop related to their creation of a new engineering program. [CEAS program at Albany](http://www.albany.edu/ceas/)

In Summer 2014 I visited the University of Texas at El Paso and, along
with Jessica Townsend, consulted with faculty and students there about
their new program in engineering leadership. [E-Lead at UTEP](http://e-lead.utep.edu/)

In Spring 2015 I visited the University of Twente in the Netherlands to
lead workshops and consult regarding their ATLAS program (Technology and
Liberal Arts & Sciences).
[ATLAS at Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/bachelor/programmes/university-college-twente/)

In Summer 2015 I visited Insper in Brazil to collaborate with their
faculty in data science and software engineering, and I have worked with
their faculty during many visits to Olin.
[Insper press release](http://www.insper.edu.br/en/newsroom/insper-news/olin-college-of-engineering-brazils-insper-to-collaborate-on-creation-of-new-engineering-school-in-sao-paulo/)

In Spring 2016 I visited James Madison University and the University of
Richmond to meet with faculty and students and present “Python as a Way
of Thinking”.
[Speaker series announcement](https://www.jmu.edu/events/cs/2016/04/20-cs-speaker-series-allen-downey.shtml)

In Summer 2016, Sanjoy Mahajan and I created a full-day Focus Workshop
for the Collaboratory.
[Workshop description](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/summer-institute/focus-workshops/#Bayesian_Statistics_for_Undergraduates)

In the future I will continue to seek opportunities to influence engineering
education at other institutions through this kind of direct engagement.


[Committee work](#committee-work)
=======

In 2010-11 I was a member of ARB.

In 2011-12 I was chair of the search committee.

In 2012-13 I was a member of the search committee and interim Associate
Director of SCOPE (Fall semester).

In 2013-14 I was executive chair of ARB. I also worked with Jessica
Townsend and our Office of Communication to revise the content of the
Olin web pages.

In 2014-15 I was executive chair of ARB. I was also a member of
the Collaboratory Task Force.

In 2015-16 I was on leave and did not serve on committees.

Each year since 2007 I have organized the SCOPE team allocation process
using software and processes developed with Prof Mark Chang.

In 2014 and 2015 I was a member of the PyCon Tutorial Selection
Committee; in 2016 I was a co-chair.

In 2016-17, I hope to work with the next incarnation of the ARB to
design procedures and structures that reflect our curriculum and the
organization of the faculty.
