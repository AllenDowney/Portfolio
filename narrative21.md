Overview of my professional activities in 2020.


## Data Science

I am continuing work on an undergraduate curriculum in Data Science for use at Olin and other schools.

In Spring 2020, I taught Data Science at Olin in parallel with the [first offering of DS10 at Harvard](http://datascience10.org/2020/).
Both classes were based on a new online data science curriculum I developed in collaboration with faculty at Harvard,
called ["Elements of Data Science"](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/).

The curriulum also includes two case studies on:

* [Political alignment in the U.S.](https://allendowney.github.io/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy) and
* [Recidivism and algorithmic fairness](https://allendowney.github.io/RecidivismCaseStudy/).

In Fall 2020, I taught Data Science at Ashesi University in Ghana, 
as part of their [Archer Cornfield Fellowship](https://www.ashesi.org/blog/announcement-fellowships-for-visiting-lecturers/).

My online course, ["Exploratory Data Analysis in Python"](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/allen-downey), is ongoing.
At this point, more people have taken this course online than I have taught, in person, in my academic career.

From July 2020 to July 2021 I was a member of 
[DataCamp's Instructor Advisory Board](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/instructor-advisory-board-member-announcement).

In 2020 I published several blog articles related to Data Science, including:

* 

Related to my work on Bayesian statistics for undergrads, 

* I have started work on a second edition of [*Think Bayes*](), which will be published by O'Reilly Media in 2021.

in February I presented 
["The Bayesian Zig Zag: Developing Probabilistic Models Using Grid Methods and MCMC"]() for an online conference,
[PyData 2020]().

At SciPy in July, I led a half-day tutorial called 
[Bayesian Statistics Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0BiV9n_fQ).

In Spring 2020 I will teach Data Science at Olin in parallel with DS10 at Harvard, with both classes using
the new curriculum my collaborators and I developed.


## Computational Modeling

In January, I collaborated with Jason Moore from UC Davis to lead a workshop, ["Eight Ways to Use Computation to Teach Everything Else"](https://engineeringunleashed.com/Events/NationalConference.aspx?EventGuid=c4a40a01-ae26-4f3a-99ef-2ec4039244f9#workshops), at the KEEN National Conference.

In March I presented [a version of this workshop at Harvard University](https://linc.seas.harvard.edu/event/faculty-workshop-0).  I also taught this workshop in a longer format at 
[Olin's Summer Institute 2019](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/summer-institute/) in June.

During the summer I revised 
[*Modeling and Simulation in Python*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/) and 
[the accompanying software](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy), which were used in the fall offering of 
[Modeling and Simulation](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1675202/) at Olin. 

In July I taught a half-day tutorial on
[Complexity Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccA6ghSW1Iw) at SciPy 2019.

In the fall semester I taught [Complexity Science](https://sites.google.com/site/complexityscience19/) at Olin.
Some of the more successful projects are 
[here](https://github.com/kdy304g/ComplexLizards-CA/blob/master/reports/final_report.md), 
[here](https://github.com/jzerez/swarm_classification/blob/master/reports/Final_Report.md), and 
[here](https://sportsracer48.github.io/2019-12-11-Cooperation/).

I am continuing to revise [*Physical Modeling in MATLAB*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/), 
to be published by [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com) in 2020.
I am working with MathWorks toward developing [online materials to support the book](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72277-physicalmodelinginmatlab).

## Free books

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses make possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and lead to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.

[*Think Julia*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920215707.do), a collaboration with Ben Lauwens at the Royal Military Academy in Belgium, 
was published by O'Reilly Media in April 2019.

[*Think Java, 2nd edition*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920304364.do), a collaboration with Chris Mayfield at James Madison University, was
published by O'Reilly Media in December 2019.
A version of *Think Java* has been adapted as an [interactive online book by Trinket](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/).

I continue to develop [*Think OS*](http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/) and 
[*The Little Book of Semaphores*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/), 
which I used in the Spring 2019 offering of 
[Software Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/softsys19/).

Several of my books have been licensed by Codio and are in development as [interactive online books](https://www.codio.com/blog/introducing-codio-books).

In 2019, new translations of my books have been published in Russian, 
traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese.  Other books have been licensed for translation into
Polish, Greek, and Korean.

My course material, slides from my presentations, and material from my
workshops are published on the web. And the supporting code for my
classes and books are on GitHub, where anyone can copy, modify, and make
corrections and contributions.

Because my books are freely available, they are used in classes all over
the world.  Since my last report, I have heard from people using them
at 


In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don't publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.
