Overview of my professional activities in 2020.


## Data Science

I am continuing work on an undergraduate curriculum in Data Science for
use at Olin and other schools.

In Spring 2020, I taught [Data Science at Olin](https://sites.google.com/site/olinds20/)
in parallel with the
[first offering of DS10 at Harvard](http://datascience10.org/2020/).
Both classes were based on a new online curriculum I developed in
collaboration with faculty at Harvard,
called ["Elements of Data Science"](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/).

The curriculum includes two case studies on:

* [Political alignment in the U.S.](https://allendowney.github.io/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy) and
* [Recidivism and algorithmic fairness](https://allendowney.github.io/RecidivismCaseStudy/).

In Fall 2020, I taught Data Science at Ashesi University in Ghana,
as part of their [Archer Cornfield Fellowship](https://www.ashesi.org/blog/announcement-fellowships-for-visiting-lecturers/).

My online course, ["Exploratory Data Analysis in Python"](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/allen-downey), is ongoing.
At this point, more people have taken this course online than I have taught,
in person, in my academic career.

From July 2019 to July 2020 I was a member of
[DataCamp's Instructor Advisory Board](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/instructor-advisory-board-member-announcement).

In 2020 I published several blog articles related to Data Science, including:

* [Millennials are not getting married](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2020/10/21/millennials-are-not-getting-married/)

* [Alice and Bob exchange data](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2020/07/26/alice-and-bob-exchange-data/)

* [Bayesian Hypothesis Testing](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2020/04/13/bayesian-hypothesis-testing/)

In November I led a half-day workshop,
["Exploratory Data Analysis with Pandas and Matplotlib"](https://global.pydata.org/talks/363) for
PyData Global 2020.


## Bayesian Statistics

As part of my work on Bayesian Statistics for undergraduates:

* I worked on a major revision of [*Think Bayes*](http://allendowney.github.io/ThinkBayes2).
The second edition will be published by O'Reilly Media in 2021.

* I started work on [*Bite Size Bayes*](https://allendowney.github.io/BiteSizeBayes),
an introduction to Bayesian statistics designed to be incorporated into existing
statistics classes, which I hope will make it easier to adopt than a completely
new class.  The Python version is nearly done; I plan to translate it into R.

* As a classroom activity, I designed a dice game called
[*The Shakes*](https://allendowney.github.io/TheShakes)
that demonstrates Thompson sampling, a strategy for Bayesian medical testing.  

In October I led a half-day workshop, ["Bayesian Statistics Made Simple"](https://odsc.com/speakers/bayesian-statistics-made-simple-2/) for the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC West) 2020,
and presented ["The Bayesian Zig Zag"](https://discourse.pymc.io/t/the-bayesian-zig-zag-developing-and-testing-pymc-models-by-allen-downey/5978) for the first annual PyMC Conference.


## Computational Science

I collaborated with [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) to develop a
new curriculum on computational tools for large astronomical datasets
(supported by funding from the American
Institute of Physics and the American Astronomical Society).
We taught a pilot workshop based on this curriculum in November and debuted
in January 2021 at the [annual meeting of the American Astronomical Society](https://my.aas.org/services/AAS_Member/Events/Event_Display.aspx?EventKey=WTR_21R).

I have published the astronomy curriculum as an online book, [*Astronomical Data in Python*](https://allendowney.github.io/AstronomicalData/index.html).

I am continuing work on

* [*Physical Modeling in MATLAB*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/),
to be published by [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com) in 2021, and

* [Modeling and Simulation in Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/).

In March I revised *Think DSP* and released
[version 1.1](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2020/06/03/think-dsp-v1-1/).

In September I presented a talk for the first DSP Online Conference:
["In Search of The Fourth Wave"](https://www.dsponlineconference.com/session/In_Search_of_the_Fourth_Wave).


## Free books

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses make possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and lead to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.

In 2020, new translations of my books include:

* *Think Java* in Polish (Helion).

* *Think Python* in Greek (Klidarithmos Publications) and
[Spanish](https://github.com/jorgelespinoza/ThinkPython2-spanish)

* *Think Julia* in Korean (Hanbit Media),
simplified Chinese (China Electric Power Press),
traditional Chinese (GoTop Information Inc.),
 [Spanish](https://introajulia.org/),
 [Brazilian Portuguese](https://juliaintro.github.io/JuliaIntroBR.jl/index.html), and
[Persian](http://www.naghoospress.ir/bookview.aspx?bookid=1487109).

* *Think DSP* in [Italian](https://github.com/BravoBaldo/ThinkDSP_Ita)

* *Think Complexity* in simplified Chinese (China Machine Press).

Because my books are freely available, they are used in classes all over
the world.  Since my last report, I have heard from people using them at
Allegheny College,
A.L. Brown High School,
The Athenian School,
Carleton College,
The Citadel,
Dallas College,
De Anza College,
Faith Academy,
Harper College,
Longwood University,
Merced College,
Miami Dade College,
Minnesota State University,
Miss Hall's School,
Missouri Western State University,
Pierce College,
Prince George's Community College,
Santa Monica College,
Simon Fraser University,
Temple University,
Trident University,
UCLA,
UCSC,
University of the People,
University of Wisconsin,
CETYS University (Mexico),
Chang Gung University (Taiwan),
Istanbul Data Science Academy (Turkey),
National University of Engineering (Peru), and
the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria.

In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don't publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.
