Overview of my professional activities in 2019.


## Data Science

I am continuing work on an undergraduate curriculum in Data Science for use at Olin and other schools.

In September I was appointed as a Visiting Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University, 
where I was a co-instructor for a [graduate data science seminar](http://stat250.org/2019/) and 
collaborated on developing
[a new data science class which will be offered in Spring 2020](http://datascience10.org/2020/).

One of my contributions is a new online data science curriculum,
called ["Elements of Data Science"](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/),
and two case studies on:

* [Political alignment in the U.S.](https://github.com/AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy) and
* [Survival Analysis](https://github.com/AllenDowney/SurvivalAnalysisPython).

In the spring I taught [Data Science](https://sites.google.com/site/olinds19/) at Olin.
As a class project, some students participated in the [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/).
[One of the more successful projects](https://github.com/ASHSWAN1999/DataScienceProject2/blob/master/report2.md)
looked at the effect of the Opioid Epidemic on life expectancy in the U.S.;
[I published a summary of the class projects in my blog](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/03/20/happiness-mental-health-drugs-politics-and-language/).

In April I launched an online course with DataCamp,
["Exploratory Data Analysis in Python"](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/allen-downey).
At this point, almost as many people have taken this course online as I have taught, in person, in my academic career.
Since July I have been a member of 
[DataCamp's Instructor Advisor Board](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/instructor-advisory-board-member-announcement).

In July I presented a talk at SciPy, ["Generational Changes in Support for Gun Laws: A Case Study in Computational Statistics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI7lEMXHypw).
and made a presentation for the teen track.
I served on the SciPy tutorial selection committee.

In September I completed [instructor training with The Carpentries](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/21-carpentries/index.html).

In September I attended the New England Isolated Statisticians Meeting (NEISM) at Wellesley College.

In November I presented "The Inspection Paradox is Everywhere" at the
[PyData NYC Conference](https://pydata.org/nyc2019/speaker/profile/107/allen-downey/) and the
[PyData Boston Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Boston-Cambridge/events/266108920/)

In 2019 I published several blog articles related to Data Science, including:

* [A series of articles on political alignment in the U.S.](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/08/06/left-right-part-4/)
* [An article on characterizing the tail behavior of distributions](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/08/13/watch-your-tail/)
* [An update of my previous reports on marriage patterns in the U.S.](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/02/21/are-men-getting-married-later-or-never-both/) 

These articles were viewed more than 30,000 times.
In an experiment to reach a broader audience, I wrote several articles on Medium, 
two of which were picked up by the online publication [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com):

* [The Inspection Paradox is Everywhere](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere-2ef1c2e9d709?source=friends_link&sk=a38a2925e44f481d27e5b2452128716a)
* [Are first babies more likely to be late?](https://towardsdatascience.com/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late-1b099b5796b6?source=friends_link&sk=6041310cba17727a1312b40488300b31)

These articles were viewed more than 35,000 times.

Related to my work on Bayesian statistics for undergrads, in February I presented 
["The Bayesian Zig Zag: Developing Probabilistic Models Using Grid Methods and MCMC"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuiJ-0ROvGA) as 
[a TechTalk for the ACM Learning Center](https://on.acm.org/t/the-bayesian-zig-zag-developing-probabilistic-models-using-grid-methods-and-mcmc/853).

At SciPy in July, I led a half-day tutorial called 
[Bayesian Statistics Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0BiV9n_fQ).

In Spring 2020 I will teach Data Science at Olin in parallel with DS10 at Harvard, with both classes using
the new curriculum my collaborators and I developed.


## Computational Modeling

In January, I collaborated with Jason Moore from UC Davis to lead a workshop, ["Eight Ways to Use Computation to Teach Everything Else"](https://engineeringunleashed.com/Events/NationalConference.aspx?EventGuid=c4a40a01-ae26-4f3a-99ef-2ec4039244f9#workshops), at the KEEN National Conference.

In March I presented [a version of this workshop at Harvard University](https://linc.seas.harvard.edu/event/faculty-workshop-0).  I also taught this workshop in a longer format at 
[Olin's Summer Institute 2019](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/summer-institute/) in June.

During the summer I revised 
[*Modeling and Simulation in Python*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/) and 
[the accompanying software](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ModSimPy), which were used in the fall offering of 
[Modeling and Simulation](https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1675202/) at Olin. 

In July I taught a half-day tutorial on
[Complexity Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ccA6ghSW1Iw) at SciPy 2019.

In the fall semester I taught [Complexity Science](https://sites.google.com/site/complexityscience19/) at Olin.
Some of the more successful projects are 
[here](https://github.com/kdy304g/ComplexLizards-CA/blob/master/reports/final_report.md), 
[here](https://github.com/jzerez/swarm_classification/blob/master/reports/Final_Report.md), and 
[here](https://sportsracer48.github.io/2019-12-11-Cooperation/).

I am continuing to revise [*Physical Modeling in MATLAB*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/), 
to be published by [No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com) in 2020.
I am working with MathWorks toward developing [online materials to support the book](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/72277-physicalmodelinginmatlab).

## Free books

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses make possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and lead to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.

[*Think Julia*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920215707.do), a collaboration with Ben Lauwens at the Royal Military Academy in Belgium, 
was published by O'Reilly Media in April 2019.

[*Think Java, 2nd edition*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920304364.do), a collaboration with Chris Mayfield at James Madison University, was
published by O'Reilly Media in December 2019.
A version of *Think Java* has been adapted as an [interactive online book by Trinket](https://books.trinket.io/thinkjava/).

I continue to develop [*Think OS*](http://greenteapress.com/thinkos/) and 
[*The Little Book of Semaphores*](https://greenteapress.com/wp/semaphores/), 
which I used in the Spring 2019 offering of 
[Software Systems](https://sites.google.com/site/softsys19/).

Several of my books have been licensed by Codio and are in development as [interactive online books](https://www.codio.com/blog/introducing-codio-books).

In 2019, new translations of my books have been published in Russian, 
traditional Chinese, and simplified Chinese.  Other books have been licensed for translation into
Polish, Greek, and Korean.

My course material, slides from my presentations, and material from my
workshops are published on the web. And the supporting code for my
classes and books are on GitHub, where anyone can copy, modify, and make
corrections and contributions.

Because my books are freely available, they are used in classes all over
the world.  Since my last report, I have heard from people using them
at 
Northeastern University,
Indiana University, 
San Diego State University,
University of Iowa,
University of Oregon,
San Jose State University,
Cal State University Monterey Bay,
Loyola University - Maryland,
University of New Haven, and
Black Hills State University;
Lancing College,
Dawson College,
Union College,
Santa Monica College,
Principia College, and
Berklee College of Music in Boston;
NIIT University,
Universidade Federal de Alagoas, and
Simon Bolivar University in Venezuela;
Kearsarge Regional High School,
Herricks High School,
Atkins School District, and
Ball High School in Texas.

In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don't publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.
