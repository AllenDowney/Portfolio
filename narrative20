## Data Science

I am continuing work to develop an undergraduate curriculum in Data Science for use at Olin and other schools.

Related to my work on Bayesian statistics for undergrads, in February I presented "The Bayesian Zig Zag: Developing Probabilistic Models Using Grid Methods and MCMC" 
as [a TechTalk for the ACM Learning Center](https://on.acm.org/t/the-bayesian-zig-zag-developing-probabilistic-models-using-grid-methods-and-mcmc/853).
At SciPy in July, I led a tutorial on [Bayesian Statistics Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X0BiV9n_fQ).

In September I was appointed as a Visiting Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University, 
where I was a co-instructor for a [graduate data science seminar](http://stat250.org/2019/) and 
collaborated on developing
[a new data science class which will be offered in Spring 2020](http://datascience10.org/2020/).

One of my contributions was the development of new online curricular materials,
called ["Elements of Data Science"](https://allendowney.github.io/ElementsOfDataScience/)
and two case studies on:

* [Political alignment in the U.S.](https://github.com/AllenDowney/PoliticalAlignmentCaseStudy) and
* [Survival Analysis](https://github.com/AllenDowney/SurvivalAnalysisPython).

In the spring I taught [Data Science](https://sites.google.com/site/olinds19/).
As a class project, some students participated in the [ASA DataFest](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/).
[One of the more successful projects](https://github.com/ASHSWAN1999/DataScienceProject2/blob/master/report2.md)
looked at the effect of the Opioid Epidemic on life expectancy in the U.S.;
[I published a summary of the class projects in my blog](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/03/20/happiness-mental-health-drugs-politics-and-language/).

In April I launched an online course with DataCamp, 
["Exploratory Data Analysis in Python"](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/allen-downey).
At this point, almost as many people have taken this course online as I have taught, in person, in my academic career.
Since July I have been a member of 
[DataCamp's Instructor Advisor Board](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog/instructor-advisory-board-member-announcement).

In July I presented a talk at SciPy, ["Generational Changes in Support for Gun Laws: A Case Study in Computational Statistics"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI7lEMXHypw).
and made a presentation for the teen track.
I served on the SciPy tutorial selection committee.

In September I attended the New England Isolated Statisticians Meeting (NEISM) at Wellesley College.

In November I presented "The Inspection Paradox is Everywhere" at 
[PyData NYC](https://pydata.org/nyc2019/speaker/profile/107/allen-downey/) and 
[PyData Boston](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Boston-Cambridge/events/266108920/)

In 2019 I published several blog articles related to Data Science, including:

* [A series of articles on political alignment in the U.S.](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/08/06/left-right-part-4/)
* [An article on characterizing the tail behavior of distributions](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/08/13/watch-your-tail/)
* [An update of my previous reports on marriage patterns in the U.S.](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2019/02/21/are-men-getting-married-later-or-never-both/) 

In 2019 articles on my blog were viewed more than 30,000 times.
In an experiment to reach a broader audience, I wrote several articles on Medium, 
two of which were picked up by the online publication [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com):

* [The Inspection Paradox is Everywhere](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere-2ef1c2e9d709?source=friends_link&sk=a38a2925e44f481d27e5b2452128716a)
* [Are first babies more likely to be late?](https://towardsdatascience.com/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late-1b099b5796b6?source=friends_link&sk=6041310cba17727a1312b40488300b31)

These articles were viewed more than 35,000 times.






## Modeling and Simulation

ModSim book

I continuing to revise
*Modeling and Simulation in MATLAB*, to be published by [Apress](https://www.apress.com/us) in 2020.

## Computation in STEM

In March I presented a workshop at Harvard University on 
["Eight Ways to Use Computation to Teach Everything Else"](https://linc.seas.harvard.edu/event/faculty-workshop-0).
I also taught this workshop at 
[Olin's Summer Institute 2019](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/summer-institute/) in June.

I collaborated with Jason Moore at U.C.Davis to develop a workshop, called
"Computation in STEM".
We presented the workshop for the first time at Davis in January 2018,
and I presented a version at Olin's Summer Instutute 2018.
Jason and I will present a version at the KEEN National Conference in January 2019.

In February 2018 I published a blog article related to new challenges in teaching programming,
[Learning to program is getting harder](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/learning-to-program-is-getting-harder.html)
It was picked up by Reddit, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16394857), 
and Slashdot, and has now been viewed more than 100,000
times, making it my second most popular article.  
As of January 2019, articles on my blog have been viewed more than 2.2 million times.

I published a second article related to the use of software engineering tools and practices
for computational science,
[The Six Stages of Computational Science](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-six-stages-of-computational-science.html), and gave a talk on these topics for the METAA CTO Clinic in March 2018.

On a related point, I developed a module for Software Design on the use of Git for version control,
and published it as part of a Git booklet I am working on.  It got a lot of attention on
Twitter, earning nearly 100,000 impressions and almost 5000 engagements, making it my top tweet ever.

I presented a [workshop based on *Think DSP*](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/39/)
at PyCon 2018 in May.  It was the third highest-rated workshop at the conference.

In March 2018 I appeared at the Jupyter Popup in Boston on a panel related to "Jupyter in Education".

In August 2018 I attended JupyterCon 2018 in New York and appeared on a panel,
["The future of Jupyter in education"](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/71871).

In November 2018 I attended a book sprint at George Washington University and helped write a 77-page draft
of [*Teaching and Learning with Jupyter*](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/).


## Complexity Science

In Fall 2017 I taught [Complexity Science](https://sites.google.com/site/complexityscience17/)
and continued work on *Think Complexity*, developing two new chapters on evolution.
The second edition was published in August 2018.

In May 2018 I presented a [workshop based on *Think Complexity*](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/56/)
at PyCon 2018.  It was the top-rated workshop at the conference.

The second edition of [*Think Complexity*](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/) was published in August 2018.



## Student planning, advising, and auditing

In 2016-17, I initiated a project to revise our policies
and processes for student planning, declaration of major, tracking progress toward
graduation, and auditing graduating seniors.  The goal of this project is to 
design procedures and structures that reflect our curriculum and the
organization of the faculty.  In 2017-18 I continued this work as a member and
co-chair of the Curriculum Working Group.

In Fall 2018, I worked with Linda Canavan, Jeremy Goodman, and Adva Waranyuwat to
collect plans of study from all Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors, and to approve
their engineering concentrations, AHS/Entrepreneurship concentrations, and plans to
satisfy other requirements.

I worked with the CWG on two other policy changes: (1) a substantial revision
of our policies for independent study, student research, student-led classes, and the OSS,
and (2) a revision to our requirements in math and science, intended to support experiments
in these areas including the next iteration of QEA.

During Summer 2018 I worked with the Registrar's office to finalize the 2018-18 Catalog.


## Free books

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses make possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and lead to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.

In the last few years, O'Reilly Media has published translations of my books
in Chinese (traditional and simplified), Japanese, Korean, French,
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Polish, Russian, and Croatian.

In addition, volunteers have translated my books into other programming
languages, including a recently-published version in Perl and 
versions-in-progress in Julia and Go.

My course material, slides from my presentations, and material from my
workshops are published on the web. And the supporting code for my
classes and books are on GitHub, where anyone can copy, modify, and make
corrections and contributions.

Because my books are freely available, they are used in classes all over
the world.  Since my last report, I have heard from people using them
at U.C. Berkeley;
Duke University;
Brigham Young University;
Northeastern University;
Longwood University;
St. Catherine University;
Southern New Hampshire University;
GHS Kumba III, Cameroon;
National University of Singapore;
Federal University of Espírito Santo, Brazil;
Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico;
Pune Institute of Business Management, India;
Breckenridge High School;
San Leandro High School.

In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don't publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.
