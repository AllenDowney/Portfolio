## Data Science

In Fall 2018 I developed an expanded (4-credit) version of
[Computational Bayesian Statistics](https://sites.google.com/site/compbayes18/)
and continued work on the second edition of *Think Bayes*.
In early 2019 I will publish the students' final projects in my blog.

In 2018 I published several blog articles related to Data Science, including:

* [August Causes ADHD](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/12/06/august-causes-adhd/)
* [Race, Religion, and Politics](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/12/28/race-religion-and-politics/)
* [Generational changes in support for gun laws](https://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/03/generational-changes-in-support-for-gun.html)

And several articles related to Bayesian Statistics, including:

* [Lions and Tigers and Bears](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/12/03/lions-and-tigers-and-bears/)
* [Cats and Rats and Elephants](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/12/11/cats-and-rats-and-elephants/)
* [The Game of Ur problem](https://www.allendowney.com/blog/2018/10/21/the-game-of-ur-problem/)

In May 2018 I presented a half-day workshop, “Bayesian Statistics Made Simple”, at ODSC East in Boston.
I also presented a talk, 
["Data Science, Data Optimism"](https://odsc.com/training/portfolio/meetup-data-science-data-optimism)

Also in May I presented a talk, 
["Bayesian Zig Zag"](https://www.meetup.com/Boston-Bayesians/events/250467013/), 
for the Boston Bayesians meetup.

In August 2018 I attended the Joint Statistical Meetings in Vancouver, Canada to
present "Inference in Three Hours, and More Time for the Good Stuff" as part of an
invited session on Statistical Education.

In September 2018 I appeared as a guest on DataFramed, a podcast from DataCamp:
[Uncertainty in Data Science, with Allen Downey](https://www.datacamp.com/community/podcast/uncertainty-data-science).

In October 2018 I attended PyData 2018 and presented a talk
["Generational changes in support for gun laws: 
a case study in computational statistics"](https://pydata.org/nyc2018/schedule/presentation/74/).

In October 2018 I attended the New England Isolated Statisticians Meeting (NEISM) at Wellesley College.

I have a contract to develop an online course for DataCamp, "Exploratory Data Analysis in Python"; I hope to test this material in Data Science in Spring 2019.



## Modeling and Simulation

During Summer 2017 I worked with Jason Woodard, Alison Wood, and Chris Lee on a substantial
revision to Modeling and Simulation.
Changes included switching from MATLAB to Python, developing
a new code library to support the class, creating Jupyter notebooks with examples and exercises, and 
writing a new book, [*Modeling and Simulation in Python*](http://greenteapress.com/wp/modsimpy/).

During Summer 2018 I revised the book and supporting software, and
worked with Jason Woodard, Alison Wood, and Erhardt Graeff to make changes to the class in response
to our experience in Fall 2017.  We co-taught the class in Fall 2018; the changes we made we
successful and the class went well.

I am working with Craig Scratchley at Simon Fraser University to revise
*Modeling and Simulation in MATLAB*, to be published by [Apress](https://www.apress.com/us) in 2019.
I also hope to publish *Modeling and Simulation in Python* in 2019.


## Computation in STEM

I collaborated with Jason Moore at U.C.Davis to develop a workshop, called
"Computation in STEM".
We presented the workshop for the first time at Davis in January 2018,
and I presented a version at Olin's Summer Instutute 2018.
Jason and I will present a version at the KEEN National Conference in January 2019.

In February 2018 I published a blog article related to new challenges in teaching programming,
[Learning to program is getting harder](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/learning-to-program-is-getting-harder.html)
It was picked up by Reddit, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16394857), 
and Slashdot, and has now been viewed more than 100,000
times, making it my second most popular article.  
As of January 2019, articles on my blog have been viewed more than 2.2 million times.

I published a second article related to the use of software engineering tools and practices
for computational science,
[The Six Stages of Computational Science](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-six-stages-of-computational-science.html), and gave a talk on these topics for the METAA CTO Clinic in March 2018.

On a related point, I developed a module for Software Design on the use of Git for version control,
and published it as part of a Git booklet I am working on.  It got a lot of attention on
Twitter, earning nearly 100,000 impressions and almost 5000 engagements, making it my top tweet ever.

I presented a [workshop based on *Think DSP*](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/39/)
at PyCon 2018 in May.  It was the third highest-rated workshop at the conference.

In March 2018 I appeared at the Jupyter Popup in Boston on a panel related to "Jupyter in Education".

In August 2018 I attended JupyterCon 2018 in New York and appeared on a panel,
["The future of Jupyter in education"](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/71871).

In November 2018 I attended a book sprint at George Washington University and helped write a 77-page draft
of [*Teaching and Learning with Jupyter*](https://jupyter4edu.github.io/jupyter-edu-book/).


## Complexity Science

In Fall 2017 I taught [Complexity Science](https://sites.google.com/site/complexityscience17/)
and continued work on *Think Complexity*, developing two new chapters on evolution.
The second edition was published in August 2018.

In May 2018 I presented a [workshop based on *Think Complexity*](https://us.pycon.org/2018/schedule/presentation/56/)
at PyCon 2018.  It was the top-rated workshop at the conference.

The second edition of [*Think Complexity*](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-complexity-2e/) was published in August 2018.



## Student planning, advising, and auditing

In 2016-17, I initiated a project to revise our policies
and processes for student planning, declaration of major, tracking progress toward
graduation, and auditing graduating seniors.  The goal of this project is to 
design procedures and structures that reflect our curriculum and the
organization of the faculty.  In 2017-18 I continued this work as a member and
co-chair of the Curriculum Working Group.

In Fall 2018, I worked with Linda Canavan, Jeremy Goodman, and Adva Waranyuwat to
collect plans of study from all Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors, and to approve
their engineering concentrations, AHS/Entrepreneurship concentrations, and plans to
satisfy other requirements.

I worked with the CWG on two other policy changes: (1) a substantial revision
of our policies for independent study, student research, student-led classes, and the OSS,
and (2) a revision to our requirements in math and science, intended to support experiments
in these areas including the next iteration of QEA.

During Summer 2018 I worked with the Registrar's office to finalize the 2018-18 Catalog.


## Free books

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses make possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and lead to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.

In the last few years, O'Reilly Media has published translations of my books
in Chinese (traditional and simplified), Japanese, Korean, French,
Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Polish, Russian, and Croatian.

In addition, volunteers have translated my books into other programming
languages, including a recently-published version in Perl and 
versions-in-progress in Julia and Go.

My course material, slides from my presentations, and material from my
workshops are published on the web. And the supporting code for my
classes and books are on GitHub, where anyone can copy, modify, and make
corrections and contributions.

Because my books are freely available, they are used in classes all over
the world.  Since my last report, I have heard from people using them
at U.C. Berkeley;
Duke University;
Brigham Young University;
Northeastern University;
Longwood University;
St. Catherine University;
Southern New Hampshire University;
GHS Kumba III, Cameroon;
National University of Singapore;
Federal University of Espírito Santo, Brazil;
Tecnologico de Monterrey, Mexico;
Pune Institute of Business Management, India;
Breckenridge High School;
San Leandro High School.

In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don't publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.
