Overview
========

The following themes pervade my work in teaching, research, and
curriculum development:

### Explore the use of computation throughout the curriculum

A major goal of my projects is to develop new approaches to math,
science, and engineering using computation. These projects make the
material more engaging, shift the balance from theory to practice, and
bring into the undergraduate curriculum topics usually assumed to be
accessible only at the graduate level.

### Integrate Data Science and Bayesian Statistics with engineering

Another goal of my work is to make working with data and
reasoning about probability a more central part of the engineering
toolkit. In many engineering schools, students study mathematical
statistics in a way that does not prepare them to work with real data,
and almost none of them study Bayesian statistics, a powerful tool for
making decisions under uncertainty, which is often a critical element of
engineering practice.

### Apply the philosophy of Free Software to writing, science, and education

All of my books are available under free licenses that allow readers to
copy, modify, and redistribute them. These licenses made possible
many translations, adaptations, and derivative works, and led to
collaborations with co-authors all over the world.
[Video of my meeting with two of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyOnRyH5uxE)

My course material, slides from my presentations, and material from my
workshops are published on the web. And the supporting code for my
classes and books are on GitHub, where anyone can copy, modify, and make
corrections and contributions.
[My GitHub repositories](https://github.com/AllenDowney?tab=repositories)

In all of my projects, I “release early and release often”, getting
constant feedback from readers and inviting collaboration. Following the
principles of Open Science, I publish data and code along with research
results, allowing others to reproduce and modify my analysis. And I
don’t publish in venues that do not make papers and supporting materials
freely available.
[The Open Science Project](http://www.openscience.org/blog/)

### Create authentic experiences that connect students to external audiences

A lot of what students write in college doesn’t work because they are
asked to write with no audience in mind and no goal for the project. In
my classes, especially Data Science and SCOPE, I try to create
experiences where students work with external collaborators on projects
that create real value. And I give students opportunities to write for
real audiences, as in Complexity Science and Bayesian Statistics, so
they get genuine feedback.

I also engage students in my writing projects, often using independent
study projects to develop and test preliminary materials, then inviting
students to provide feedback on early drafts, and providing
opportunities for them to contribute material (as in the case studies in
*Think Complexity*).


Data Science
============

Since my previous reappointment in 2010, one of my major projects has
been the development of our curriculum in data science, including
probability and statistics, Bayesian statistics, and complexity science.

Courses and books
-----------------

In Fall 2010, I developed a computational alternative to the existing
statistics class. [Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/probstatolin/)

While
teaching this class I wrote the first edition of *Think
Stats*, which was published by O’Reilly Media in 2011.
[Think Stats](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats/)

In Fall 2011, I taught Computational Modeling for the second time and
continued development of *Think Complexity*.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/compmodolin/) 

I invited the students to
work on projects that could appear as case studies in the book. I
selected four case studies that appeared in the first edition, published
by O’Reilly in 2012. [Think Complexity](http://greenteapress.com/complexity/)
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZuhWo0Nv7o)

In 2013 I won the Undergraduate Computational Engineering and Science
Award for my work on Computational Modeling and *Think
Complexity*.
[Olin press release](http://www.olin.edu/news-events/2013/downey-wins-award/)

In Spring 2013 I taught the first iteration of “Computational Bayesian
Statistics” and started work on *Think Bayes*, which was
published in Fall 2013. [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-bayes/)

In Fall 2014 I taught the class again and invited students to write
articles about their projects that could appear as guest articles on my
blog. Four of their articles appeared during Spring 2015, including
several that attracted substantial attention.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/compbayes14/)

In Spring 2014, I developed “Data Science”, which expanded the material
from “Computational Prob Stat”, adding machine learning, visualization,
and more practical aspects of working with data. I recruited 14 external
collaborators to work with student teams, providing data and motivating
question. Paul Ruvolo helped me advise student teams and develop
material. [Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/datascience14/)

Based on this
class, I substantially revised *Think Stats*, publishing
the second edition in Fall 2014. [Think Stats 2e](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)

In Spring 2015 I taught “Data Science” again in a similar format: I
recruited projects ahead of time so student teams could engage with
external collaborators for the entire semester. Paul Ruvolo helped
deliver the class again, and then he took over to offer the class in
Spring 2016 while I was on sabbatical.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/datascience15/)

In each of these projects, I involve students by recruiting them to work
on independent study projects, usually developing and test-driving
materials. And in each of the resulting classes, I connect students to
authentic external audiences, including external collaborators in Data
Science, readers of *Think Complexity*, and readers of my
blog.

[Example blog article](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/02/bayesian-analysis-of-match-rates-on.html)


Multimedia
----------

In October 2012 I presented a webcast with O’Reilly Media called
*Bayesian Statistics Made Simple*
[Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/2392)

In September 2015 I shot a 3.5 hour video series called *Data
Exploration in Python*, published by O’Reilly Media.
[Video series](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044932.do)

In May 2016 I presented a webcast for O’Reilly Media called
*Learning to Love Bayesian Statistics*.
[Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3707)

I have also made a number of presentations related to Data Science for
special interest groups in the Boston area.

Workshops
---------

Complementary to my teaching at Olin, I have developed a number of
workshops related to Data Science.

In Fall 2011, I presented the first version of “There is Only One Test”
as a webcast for O’Reilly Media. [Webcast](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/2016)

This topic has been a recurring theme in my blog and the basis of my
half-day workshop, “Computational Statistics”, which I presented at
Pycon 2015 and 2016, and SciPy 2015.
[Workshop site](https://sites.google.com/site/pyinference/)
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR52vSbHBAk)

In 2012 I created “Bayesian Statistics Made Simple”, which I presented
as a half-day workshop at PyCon 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and
also at SciPy 2015 and a few other venues.
[Workshop site](https://sites.google.com/site/simplebayes/)
[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpgiFIGXcT4)

In Summer 2016, Sanjoy Mahajan and I taught a focus workshop for the
Olin Collaboratory, “Bayesian Statistics for Undergrads”, based on our
different approaches to this topic.
[Workshop site](https://github.com/AllenDowney/BayesForUndergrads)


Consulting
----------

In Fall 2014 I started collaborating with DataKind, a non-profit
organization in New York that provides data science services for
mission-driven institutions. On several projects since then, I have
worked as a “data creative”, involved in the early stages of a project
to help identify opportunities, evaluate data and other technical
issues, and prepare projects for hand-off to a team of volunteer data
scientists.
[Featured volunteer page](http://www.datakind.org/featured-volunteers/allen-downey)

In June 2015 I flew to Orbitz headquarters in Chicago to deliver a
workshop on Bayesian statistics and to consult with groups working on
related projects.

In Spring 2016 I was appointed to the advisory board of ViaScience, a
Cambridge company that provides services related to Bayesian statistics.
[Press release](http://www.viascience.com/allen-downey-joins-via-sciences-advisory-board)

I am also on the advisory board of WebText, a company that provides
customer support platforms based on instant messaging.
[Press release](https://www.webtext.com/team/dr-allen-downey/)


Publications
------------

In addition to my workshops, I write articles that apply computational
and Bayesian statistics to data-driven explorations.

These include “Estimating the age of renal tumors”, which started as a
letter to the Veteran’s administration in support of a patient, and
became a chapter of *Think Bayes* and an article I
published on ArXiv in 2012. [ArXiV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6890)

In 2014 I developed an example of logistic regression as material for
Data Science, then published “Religious affiliation, education and
Internet use” on ArXiv. The abstract was picked up by MIT’s
*Technology Review*, and attracted substantial media
attention. [ArXiV paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5534)
[NPR](http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2014/04/21/303375159/americas-less-religious-study-puts-some-blame-on-the-internet)
[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/is-the-internet-bad-for-religion/2014/04/10/06f9f7a0-c0f3-11e3-9ee7-02c1e10a03f0_story.html)
[Fox News](http://video.foxnews.com/v/3442766571001/is-surfing-the-web-destroying-your-faith/?#sp=show-clips)
[A surprisingly good vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04jjBv6QR8k)

In 2015, I developed an example of survival analysis for Data Science,
which lead to “Will Millennials Ever Get Married?”, which I presented at
SciPy 2015, and which appeared in the proceedings. A student, Lindsey
Vanderlyn, collaborated on this project as an independent study.
[Proceeedings home page](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2015/)

In 2011, I started a blog called “Probably Overthinking It”, where I
publish articles related to data science and Bayesian statistics. Many
of these articles involve short original statistical explorations, often
using datasets from government agencies and other resources.
[Blog](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/)

Many of these articles attract attention on social media, blog
aggregators, and other media. Most articles attract more than 1000 page
views, several more than 10,000 views and a few more than 100,000. Since
2011, I have posted almost 150 articles and received almost 1.5 million
page views (NOTE: UPDATE THIS IN SEPTEMBER)

The five most popular articles are:

[“Are first babies more likely to be late?”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/02/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late.html)

[“All your Bayes are belong to us”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/10/all-your-bayes-are-belong-to-us.html)

[“My favorite Bayes’s Theorem problems”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/10/my-favorite-bayess-theorem-problems.html)

[“Bayesian survival analysis for *Game of Thrones*”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/03/bayesian-survival-analysis-for-game-of.html) Guest article by Ben Kahle and Erin Pierce.

[“The Inspection Paradox is Everywhere”](http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-inspection-paradox-is-everywhere.html)


Future plans 
------------

In Fall 2016 I will co-teach the successor of Computational Modeling,
called Complexity Science, with Jason Woodard; and I will revise
*Think Complexity* with the goal of publishing a second
edition in 2017, possibly including a new selection of student projects
as case studies.

In Fall 2016 I will teach Computational Bayesian Statistics and start
work on the second edition of *Think Bayes*. I will invite
students to develop articles we can publish in my blog, ArXiV, in the
proceedings of SciPy, or other venues.

I will continue to write blog articles as opportunities arise, looking
for topics that demonstrate the methodology of computational and
Bayesian statistics, applied to topics in science, engineering, and
social science. I have a substantial backlog of project ideas waiting to
be developed.

In Spring 2017 I will teach Data Science again, incorporating changes in
the structure and content that Paul Ruvolo developed in Spring 2016.

I expect to continue teaching workshops related to computational and
Bayesian statistics, and to look for opportunities to work with
companies interested in these areas. We are likely to have SCOPE
projects in these areas, which I will help to develop and advise.

And I plan to continue work with DataKind, depending on what projects
come through their pipeline. I will continue to look for opportunities
to connect this work with students and classes at Olin.


Computation and Engineering 
===========================

Since my last reappointment I have continued to teach and develop
software-related classes, including “Software Design”, “Software
Engineering”, and “Software Systems”, and software-based approaches to
topics in engineering, primarily “Modeling and Simulation” and “Signals
and Systems”.

Software Design
---------------

I taught Software Design in Spring and Fall 2011 and wrote the first
edition of *Think Python*, published by O’Reilly Media in
2012. Think Python is my most popular book: it is used in
high school and college classes around the world (see Appendix); the
free PDF version is downloaded from my web page almost 100,000 times per
month; and we sell hundreds of paper and electronic copies per month.
[Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/)

In Fall 2013, I taught Software Design again and began work on the
second edition of *Think Python*, which turned out to be a
more substantial revision than I planned. It was published in 2015.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/sd13fa/)
[Think Python 2e](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/)

Software Systems
----------------

In Fall 2012, I attempted a major revision of Software Systems, which
went badly for a number of reasons: one was a badly-implemented set of
in-class activities, another was the mismatch between the focus of the
class and the textbook we used.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softsys12/)

In Fall 2014, I addressed the first problem by developing a textbook
called *Think OS*, and the class was more successful.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softsys14/)

In Fall 2015, I addressed the second problem by deploying EduScrum, a
structure for student learning based on the Scrum methodology for
software development. I thought both elements – *Think OS*
and EduScrum – worked well, and I am considering using EduScrum for some
other classes. [Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softwaresystems2015/)


Modeling and Simulation
-----------------------

In June 2008, John Geddes and I went to the University of Delft to meet
with Mark Somerville to develop “Modeling and Simulation”, which we
taught in Fall 2008.

I wrote a textbook for the class, officially known as *Physical
Modeling in MATLAB*, which I self-publish through a small company
I run, Green Tea Press.
[Physical Modeling in MATLAB](http://greenteapress.com/wp/physical-modeling-in-matlab/)

Since I was on leave in 2009, we brought in other instructors to teach
and continue to develop the course. This model worked well; now about
one third of our faculty have taught ModSim at some point, and it has
become one of our tools for onboarding new professors.

I co-taught ModSim again in 2010 and 2014.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/modsim14/)


Signals and Systems
-------------------

In Spring 2014 I started work on *Think DSP*, collaborating
with two students working on independent study projects.

In Fall 2014 I offered Computational DSP for the first time, and the in
Spring 2015 I used this material when I co-taught Signals and Systems
with Siddhartan Govindasamy and Oscar Mur-Miranda. Our first attempt at
a major revision had some rough edges, but I thought the quality of the
final projects was evidence of the effectiveness of the approach.
[SigSys final projects](https://sites.google.com/site/sigsys15/problem/final-project)

In July 2015 I presented material from *Think DSP* at
SciPy. [Video of presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ALKGR0I5MA)

While developing *Think DSP*, I created a blog to publish
draft chapters from the book and related articles. This blog is not as
popular as *Probably Overthinking It*, but I have published
14 articles there, including one guest post from a student team in
Software Systems.
[SoftSys project](http://thinkdsp.blogspot.com/2015/10/fur-elise-on-arduino-synthesizer.html)

I was also invited to contribute articles to *DSP Related*,
a collection of blogs related to DSP. I have published five articles
there; the most popular is “Bayes Meets Fourier”, which presents an
efficient algorithm for a Bayes filter as used for location tracking and
other applications. This work is based on conversations with Paul Ruvolo
during our “Kalman and Bayes filter book club” in Fall 2015.
[DSP Related blog](https://www.dsprelated.com/blogs-1/nf/Allen_Downey.php)

In August 2016 *Think DSP* was published by O’Reilly Media.
[Think DSP](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-dsp/)


Software Engineering
--------------------

In Spring 2011 and Spring 2013 I taught Software Engineering and
developed materials related to algorithms and data structures in Java.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/softengjava13/)

In Fall 2012 I began a collaboration with Prof. Chris Mayfield at James
Madison University, revising my book *How To Think Like a Computer
Scientist* under the new title *Think Java*, which
was published by O’Reilly Media in June 2016.
[Think Java](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-java/)

In February 2016 I was commissioned by the Flatiron School in New York
to develop a curriculum for their online class on data structures and
algorithms in Java, using material from Software Engineering. The first
group of students tested the course in Summer 2016.


Other classes
-------------

In Spring 2012 I sat in on Principles of Engineering, which was taught
by Chris Murphy. This experience allowed me to make connections between
our software classes and other areas of engineering; as an example, I
introduced a project in Software Systems where students build and
program an Arduino-based synthesizer
[SoftSys synthesizer](http://thinkdsp.blogspot.com/2014/02/build-softsyssynth.html)

Also in Spring 2012 I taught Foundations of Computer Science and
developed new material related to languages, automata, computability and
Godel’s theorem using Python.
[Class web page](https://sites.google.com/site/focsolin12/)

I advised the following SCOPE projects: Parietal Systems, 2012-13; Facebook, 2013-14; Apportable 2014-15.


Student-led classes
-------------------

In Fall 2011 I was the advisor for one of the first student-led classes on mobile application development, MobDev,
and I led an independent study on teaching and learning for the 4 students leading the class.

In Fall 2012, mobile development was led by an alumnus, Rachel Steadman, but I was the advisor of record
for 6 students who completed an OSS project.

In Spring 2013, a group of students developed a new course on web application development, called WebDev or OlinJS, and
we adopted a structure where I was the advisor of the 24 students in the class; I met with the student instructors
to discuss the operation of the class, and another faculty member led an independent study project on
teaching and learning with the student instructors.

In Fall 2013, I worked with Paul Ruvolo to define criteria and processes for student-led classes.  He and
I advised the next iteration of ModDev in the Fall and WebDev in Spring 2014.

These classes were offered again in Fall 2014 and Spring 2015???



Future plans
------------

*Think Algorithms*

In Spring 2017 I will teach Software Systems again, possibly co-teaching
with Ben Hill. I think we have an opportunity to improve the connection
between Software Systems and Architecture, and to ensure that we have
more flexibility in future offerings of SoftSys.

I am continuing work on *Think OS*, planning to incorporate
material from *The Little Book of Semaphores* and to make
the accompanying thread simulator, Sync, more robust. In
many CS programs, introductory classes are moving from languages like C
and C++ to higher-level languages like Python. This shift creates a gap
between the introductory sequence and classes like Operating Systems and
Networks. Think OS is in a good position to fill this gap.

For several years we have discussed the possibility of shifting ModSim
from MATLAB to Octave, Python, or Mathematica. If we make a move like
this, I will probably revise *Physical Modeling in MATLAB*
accordingly.

For the more remote future, I have my eyes open for opportunities to
collaborate with colleagues to develop computational approaches in other
areas of engineering, math, and natural and social science.

Collaboratory
=============

In Summer 2011 I visited KTH in Stockholm to meet with instructors who
had previously participated in workshops at Olin.

In 2013, 2014, and 2015 I participated in the Collaboratory Summer
Institute and co-led at least one workshop.
[Summer institute](http://www.olin.edu/collaborate/collaboratory/summer-institute/student-engagement)

In Spring 2014 I visited the University of Albany and led a curriculum
development workshop. [CEAS program at Albany](http://www.albany.edu/ceas/)

In Summer 2014 I visited the University of Texas at El Paso and, along
with Jessica Townsend, consulted with faculty and students there about
their new program in engineering leadership. [E-Lead at UTEP](http://e-lead.utep.edu/)

In Spring 2015 I visited the University of Twente in the Netherlands to
lead workshops and consult regarding their ATLAS program (Technology and
Liberal Arts & Sciences).
[ATLAS at Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/education/bachelor/programmes/university-college-twente/)

In Summer 2015 I visited Insper in Brazil to collaborate with their
faculty in data science and software engineering, and I have worked with
their faculty during many visits to Olin.

In Spring 2016 I visited James Madison University and the University of
Richmond to meet with faculty and students and present “Python as a Way
of Thinking”.
[Speaker series announcement](https://www.jmu.edu/events/cs/2016/04/20-cs-speaker-series-allen-downey.shtml)

In Summer 2016, Sanjoy Mahajan and I created a full-day Focus Workshop
for the Collaboratory.
